This program contains two parts: a global function VecAdd and main function. The global function is used for string searching for each thread on GPU. In the main function, the program first read the file and store read lines on memory of CPU. And then copy the lines to memory on GPU. The GPU will call VecAdd to execute a thread for each read line and then store the results in a string array on memory of GPU. At last the results will be copied to memory of CPU and be printed. The flow of the program is shown in figure below.
